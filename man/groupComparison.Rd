\title{Finding differentially abundant proteins across conditions in targeted Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM), Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA or shotgun), and Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA or SWATH-MS) experiment}
\description{Tests for significant changes in protein abundance across conditions based on a family of linear mixed-effects  models in targeted Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM), Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA or shotgun), and Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA or SWATH-MS)
 experiment. It is applicable to multiple types of sample preparation, including label-free workflows, workflows that use stable isotope labeled reference proteins and peptides, and workflows that use fractionation. Experimental design of case-control study (patients are not repeatedly measured) or time course study (patients are repeatedly measured) is automatically determined based on proper statistical model.

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{contrast.matrix}{comparison between conditions of interests.}
  \item{data}{name of the (output of dataProcess function) data set.}
}

\details{

\itemize{
\item{contrast.matrix : comparison of interest. Based on the levels of conditions, specify 1 or -1 to the conditions of interests and 0 otherwise. The levels of conditions are sorted alphabetically. Command levels(QuantData$ProcessedData$GROUP_ORIGINAL) can illustrate the actual order of the levels of conditions.}

}
The underlying model fitting functions are \code{\link[stats]{lm}} and \code{\link[lme4]{lmer}} for the fixed effects model and mixed effects model, respectively.  

The input of this function is the quantitative data from function (\code{\link{dataProcess}}).
}

\value{A list of data.frame \emph{ComparisonResult} is the data.frame for the result of significance analysis ; \emph{fittedModel} is the the data.frame for run-level summarized data.}
