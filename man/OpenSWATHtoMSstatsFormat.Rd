\arguments{
\item{input}{name of MSstats input report from OpenSWATH, which includes feature-level data.}

\item{annotation}{name of 'annotation.txt' data which includes Condition, BioReplicate, Run.
Run should be the same as filename.}

\item{filter_with_mscore}{TRUE(default) will filter out the features that have greater than mscore_cutoff in m_score column. Those features will be removed.}

\item{mscore_cutoff}{Cutoff for m_score. Default is 0.01.}

\item{useUniquePeptide}{TRUE (default) removes peptides that are assigned for more than one proteins.
We assume to use unique peptide for each protein.}

\item{fewMeasurements}{'remove'(default) will remove the features that have 1 or 2 measurements across runs.}

\item{removeProtein_with1Feature}{TRUE will remove the proteins which have only 1 feature, which is the combination of peptide, precursor charge, fragment and charge. FALSE is default.}

\item{summaryforMultipleRows}{max(default) or sum - when there are multiple measurements for certain feature and certain run, use highest or sum of multiple intensities.}

\item{use_log_file}{lgl, if TRUE, messages from the converter functions will be written to a log file.}

\item{append}{lgl, if TRUE, messages will be appended to an existing file.}

\item{verbose}{lgl, if TRUE, messages from the converter functions will be printed to the console.}
