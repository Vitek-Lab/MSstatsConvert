\usage{
OpenMStoMSstatsFormat(
  input,
  annotation = NULL,
  useUniquePeptide = TRUE,
  fewMeasurements = "remove",
  removeProtein_with1Feature = FALSE,
  summaryforMultipleRows = max
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{name of MSstats input report from OpenMS, which includes feature(peptide ion)-level data.}

\item{annotation}{name of 'annotation.txt' data which includes Condition, BioReplicate, Run.
Run should be the same as filename.}

\item{useUniquePeptide}{TRUE (default) removes peptides that are assigned for more than one proteins.
We assume to use unique peptide for each protein.}

\item{fewMeasurements}{'remove'(default) will remove the features that have 1 or 2 measurements across runs.}

\item{removeProtein_with1Feature}{TRUE will remove the proteins which have only 1 feature, which is the combination of peptide, precursor charge, fragment and charge. FALSE is default.}

\item{summaryforMultipleRows}{max(default) or sum - when there are multiple measurements for certain feature and certain run, use highest or sum of multiple intensities.}
}
\value{
data.frame with the required format of MSstats.
