\title{Planning future experimental designs of Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM), Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA or shotgun), and Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA or SWATH-MS) experiments in sample size calculation}
\description{Calculate sample size for future experiments of a Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM), Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA or shotgun), and Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA or SWATH-MS) experiment based on intensity-based linear model. Two options of the calculation: (1) number of biological replicates per condition, (2) power.}
\usage{
designSampleSize(data=data,desiredFC=desiredFC,FDR=0.05,numSample=TRUE,power=0.9)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data}{'fittedmodel' in testing output from function groupComparison.}
  \item{desiredFC}{the range of a desired fold change which includes the lower and upper values of the desired fold change.}
  \item{FDR}{a pre-specified false discovery ratio (FDR) to control the overall false positive. Default is 0.05}
  \item{numSample}{minimal number of biological replicates per condition. TRUE represents you require to calculate the sample size for this category, else you should input the exact number of biological replicates.}
  \item{power}{a pre-specified statistical power which defined as the probability of detecting a true fold change. TRUE represent you require to calculate the power for this category, else you should input the average of power you expect. Default is 0.9}
}

\details{The function fits the model and uses variance components to calculate sample size. The underlying model fitting with intensity-based linear model with technical MS run replication. Estimated sample size is rounded to 0 decimal.
}

\value{A list of the sample size calculation results including Variable desiredFC, numSample, numPep, numTran, FDR,  and power.}
